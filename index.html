                    For the previous few years, Melbourne has been the fourth fastest expanding market in the country,
                    behind Canberra, Sydney, and Hobart. Housing costs in the city range from $500 to $10,000 per square metre.
                    Housing prices are also affected by distance, the closer a unit is to the CBD, the higher the price.
                    Suburbs such as Port Melboune, Southbank, Collingwood, and Carlton has a land price of $5,000 per square metre. 
                    Meanwhile, suburbs such as Gisbone, Emerald, Epping has a relatively lower land price.

                <p> The majority of the <span style = "color:#1280FD">houses</span> that are available in the market was built after the 1900s.
                    It appears that the size of the land has little to no bearing on the price, 
                    while small house built later have a greater price than older <span style = "color:#1280FD">houses</span> with larger land size built earlier.

                    <span style = "color:#F6810C">Townhouse</span> and <span style = "color:#F60CD7">Units</span> has a range of $3,000 or lower which is significantly lower compared to House's price range 
                    that could be up to $9,000. Most of the <span style = "color:#F6810C">townhouse</span> and <span style = "color:#F60CD7">units</span> were built in after the 1950s with a smaller size compared 
                    to the ones that were built early 1900s.

                <br>
                    Majority of <span style = "color:#1280FD">houses</span> have 3 to 4 rooms in it with a price range bellow $5,000.

                <h3> How Does Price Evolve Overtime?</h3>
                
                <p> 
                    In this graph, there is a recurring pattern in which the number of units sold drops below 20 units for all regions in the beginning of December. 
                    This is followed by a massive surge in every location over the next few days.  
                    During the period, the <span style = "color:#0066CC">Northern Metropolitan Area</span> had the highest number of units sold. 
                    While the number of units sold in parts of Victoria has the lowest total units sold during the period span.
